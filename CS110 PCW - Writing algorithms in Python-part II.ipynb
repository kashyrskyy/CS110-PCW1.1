    "I would define a class named ClassGrade, with attributes of grades for different Learning Outcomes of the course (saved as integers for using mathematical methods to compute grade averages). The instance of this class would store Class grades in the dictionaries per LO (so actual attribute will be a CO, which is storing grades for the particular LO like a dictionary); if the grade is weighted 2 times, it will be added to that dictionary twice (and if 3 - three times) to ease the computation in methods. The method for calculating the grade would be define with a formula of (1) total grade = sum of COs/#n of COs, which is just the sum of separate COs (an average grade for LOs) divided by their quantity, (2) for COs individually the formula will be CO = (1/#n of LOs)*((grade by its weight+grade by its weight...)/divided by the sum of weights) + ... Here all 1/n have to sum up to one (as these are fractions of LOs per single CO). As we get instances for each student, at the end of the semester it will be possible to calculate the total grade. It will be getting updated throughout the semester as new grades come in and are stored in the dictionaries of each Learning Outcome. However, I am not sure if the calculation will be valid (or if it can work) if the student does not have any grade for the LO (which means the 1/n will change when calculating CO, and that missing LO's dictionary will be empty); I believe an instance will have to be filled out for each LO at bare minimum of 1 input (1 grade) for the CO to be calculated properly."
